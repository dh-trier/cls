::
- Hello, everyone. 
- Thank you for the invitation to this conference
- I'm sorry I can only join you by videoconference
- I will speak about "Computational Literary Studies" today
- I know many of you are interested in Digital History
- The challenges I will speak about are quite general,
- so I hope my remarks will still be relevant to you


--
## Overview
1. [Operationalization | 操作化](#/3)
1. [Metadata | 元数据](#/4)
1. [Diversity | 多样性](#/5)
1. [Open Access | 开放获取](#/6)


::
- I will briefly introduce the field of Computational Literary Studies
- And I will then speak about four major, high-level challenges I see for the field
- I believe it is really important that these challenges continue to be addressed, going into the future
- Computational Literary Studies (CLS) is a subfield of Digital Humanities concerned with using methods from Computer Science and Statistics for the investigation of literary texts. 
- CLS has a long tradition within Digital Humanities. 
- Research questions in CLS are in part those of established literary studies, in part those arising from the transposition of methods from Computer Science and Statistics into the literary domain. 



--
## Challenge 1:<br/><br/>Operationalization<br/>操作化


---
### Why is "operationalization" important?
* Operationalization makes a research<br/> question or a hypothesis computable and verifiable <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Operationalization creates an explicit<br/> link between concepts and formal features <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


---
### Challenges in operationalization 
* Operationalization creates increased complexity <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* But it also makes that complexity more manageable <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


---
### Example: "Keyness" in the *Zeta and Company* project
<img height="400" data-src="img/zeta-project.jpg"></img>
<br/>https://zeta-project.eu/en/

::
- This is a project about measures of keyness
- "Keyness" refers to words, or other features, that are characteristic of a group of texts when comparing it to another group of texts
- We want to model, implement, evaluate keyness


---
### Crime fiction vs. science fiction
<b>crime fiction</b> (Gallimard, Série noire): <img height="180" data-src="img/serie-noire.jpg"></img>
<br/>
<b>science fiction</b> (Denoël, Présence du futur): <img height="180" data-src="img/presence-futur.jpg"></img>

::
- Our data is the contemporary French novel
- We focus on popular subgenres like crime fiction and science fiction
- Here you see some book covers for crime fiction and science fiction


---
### What is keyness?
* Concepts <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * aboutness
  * distinctiveness
  * salience
  * etc.
* measures <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * log-likelihood ratio
  * t-test
  * Burrows Zeta
  * etc. 

::
- Concepts: 
- Aboutness: words that express the content of the subgenres
- Distinctiveness: words that help distinguish one subgenre from another
- Salience: words that readers notice when reading novels from the subgenre
- Measures
- log-likelihood: compares frequencies across groups
- t-test: compares frequency distibutions
- Zeta: compares the dispersion of words
- **Key issue**: 
- how do measures and concepts relate to each other?
- t-test has a bias for function words, and is related to distinctiveness
- Burrows Zeta has a bias for content words, and is related to aboutness
- This needs to be clarified before using such measures.


--
## Challenge 2:<br/><br/>Metadata<br/>元数据

---
### Why is metadata crucial? 
* Small, well-understood corpora:<br/>metadata is easy to generate, less needed <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Large, unexplored corpora:<br/>metadata is crucial, hard to generate <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Crucial for going beyond the canon <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  * knowing the population: sampling
  * interpreting quantitative results

::
- First wave of CLS used relatively small corpora (dozens, sometimes a few hundred texts)
- Current wave of CLS is about ever larger text collections
- First thousands, now millions of books: HathiTrust: now 17 million volumes
- So metadata also helps us do analyses beyond the canon (see challenge #2: diversity)
- (a) Without a documentation of the statistical population, you can't create representative samples 
- (b) When you can't read the documents in your corpus, you need metadata to explain results


---
### Challenge of metadata
* CLS needs a complete record of literary production <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* CLS needs relevant, detailed, accurate metadata on texts <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * author: gender, related authors, etc.
  * setting: space, time
  * type: subgenre, etc.
  * content: themes, plot, protagonists
  * properties: e.g. proportion of direct speech

::
- First need: complete documentation of literary production (population)
- Second need: relevant, detailed, accurate metadata on individual texts
- But: Library catalogs usually don't have these
- So we need to generate metadata ourselves! (Agenda)

---
### Example: *Mining and Modeling Text*
<img height="450" data-src="img/mimotext-page.jpg"></img>
<br/>https://mimotext.uni-trier.de/aktuelles/english

---
### CLS Agenda: Generate metadata
<img height="500" data-src="img/mimotext-candide.jpg"></img>
<br/>Example: *Candide* by Voltaire

::
- from bibliographies and library catalogs
- from scholarly publications
- from primary texts
- Then, model it as an information network
- In the form of Linked Open Data
- Goal: Wikidata for Literary History



--
## Challenge 3:<br/><br/>Diversity<br/>多样性

::
- The DH open up an opportunity for diversity
- We have the chance to base our research on more than just a few most famous works
- in CLS, this means we can better understand the dynamics of literary history
- And better understand the meaning of literature for people


---
### Distant Reading for European Literary History
<a href="img/map-of-action-members.html"><img height="450" data-src="img/map-of-action-members-logo.jpg"></img></a>
<br/>https://distant-reading.net

::
- I would  like to illustrate the challenges of this in CLS by speaking about a project called "Distant Reading for European Literary History"
- The key aim of this project is to create a multilingual corpus of novels
- 100 novels from as many different European languages as we can
- At the moment, we are working on 17 different languages


---
### Dimensions of diversity
* In corpus building and text analysis <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * Literary production in multiple languages 
  * Highly-canonized and forgotten novels
  * Gender balance in authorship
  * Wide range of kinds of novels
* In the community we create <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * Diversity of career stages
  * Gender balance
  * Researchers from less research-intensive countries

::
- In this project, there are several dimensions of diversity that are relevant
- regarding corpus building and text analysis (name them)
- regarding the community we create in the project (name them)
- Very important to me: diversity not for the people, but with the people! 
- In this sense, this is really a "grass-roots" project


---
### Challenges
* Digitization tends to be non-diverse (!) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * driven by canonicity
  * focused on few authors
* Corpus building: "paradox of diversity" <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * support diversity of languages
  * support diversity within each collection

::
- Digitization
  - Digitization is driven by canonicity
- Paradox
  - We want to encourage a diversity of languages, including smaller literary traditions
  - And we want to encourage a diverse corpus composition (women, non-canonized, early)
  - But: for smaller languages, diverse composition is hard!
  - So: by pushing on one side, we lose on the other side
  - We need to balance both



--
## Challenge 4:<br/><br/>Open Access<br/>开放获取


---
### Open Access
* Open Access means  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * the right to access, modify, analyse, redistribute materials
  * with minimal technical, financial and legal obstacles 
* Open Access concerns <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * scholarly publications
  * primary sources (literary texts) 
* Open Access is an essential component of Open Science <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


---
### Why is Open Access important?
* Open Access enables research into our most recent cultural history <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Open Access is an essential component of Open Science <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * transparent
  * reproducible
  * sustainable  


---
### A challenge in all our projects
* Distant Reading <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * Focus determined by copyright: pre-1920 texts only
  * this allows us to practice Open Science
* Mining and Modeling Text <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * We rely on a copyright exception for Text Mining 
  * But we can't publish the texts underlying our extracted metadata
* Zeta and company <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> 
  * 20th-century novels: we can't distribute our corpora
  * limited transparency and reproducibility

---
### Challenges of Open Access
* Create a new balance
  * between legitimate copyright interests
  * and the benefits of excellent research for society
* Create new institutional roles of academia
  * As distributors of scholarly publications  
  * As creators of digital resources

::
- New balance
- New roles
- Also: work beyond academia

--
## Conclusion

---
### Four Challenges of CLS
1. Operationalization: "deconstruction" of concepts and measures <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. Diversity: increase diversity in research objects and the research community <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Metadata: generate metadata for very large corpora <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. Open Access: look beyond purely scholarly concerns <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
