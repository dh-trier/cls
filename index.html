## Overview
1. [Computational Literary Studies](#/3)
1. [Operationalization](#/4)
1. [Metadata](#/5)
1. [Diversity](#/6)
1. [Reproducibility](#/7)


::
- Before I get started with the four challenges, I would like to briefly introduce the field of Computational Literary Studies
- And I will then speak about four major, high-level challenges I see for the field
- I believe it is really important that these challenges continue to be addressed, going into the future


--
## Computational<br/>Literary Studies

---
### Many terms, one field? 
* Stylometry
* Literary and Linguistic Computing
* Distant Reading
* Computational Stylistics 
* Digital Literary Stylistics
* Computational Literary Studies

::
- CLS has, under various names, been around since the early 1960s
- Mosteller and Wallace or Enkvist with quantitative methods of "non-traditional authorship attribution" 
- Then the big wave of "Distant Reading", in the wake of Franco Moretti 
- And what I consider the current best designation, CLS
- Not limited to style or authorship, but literary concerns more generally
- Not just digital, but computational: machine learning, statistics, quantitative approaches


---
### Computational Literary Studies
<img height="500" data-src="img/cls.jpg"></img>

::
- Computational Literary Studies (CLS) is a subfield of Digital Humanities concerned with using methods from Computer Science and Statistics for the investigation of literary texts. 
- CLS has a long tradition within Digital Humanities. 
- Research questions in CLS are in part those of established literary studies, in part those arising from the transposition of methods from Computer Science and Statistics into the literary domain. 
- Indeed, the four challenges are not those of literary studies, but really those of CLS itself



--
## Challenge 1:<br/><br/>Operationalization


---
### What is meant by operationalization?
* Creates an explicit<br/> link between concepts and formal features <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Makes a research<br/> question or a hypothesis computable and verifiable <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Creates increased complexity, mainly through decomposition <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* But also makes that complexity more manageable <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* Many examples <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
  * subgenres
  * canonicity
  * complexity
  * distinctiveness


---
### Example: "Distinctiveness"<br/>in the *Zeta and Company* project
<img height="400" data-src="img/zeta-project.jpg"></img>
<br/>https://zeta-project.eu/en/

::
- This is a project about measures of distinctiveness
- Distinctiveness, also called "keyness" in linguistics, refers to words, or other features, that are characteristic of a group of texts when comparing it to another group of texts
- We want to model, implement, evaluate, and use measures of distinctiveness


---
### Subgenres of the contemporary French novel
<b>crime fiction</b> (Gallimard, Série noire): <img height="180" data-src="img/serie-noire.jpg"></img>
<br/>
<b>science fiction</b> (Denoël, Présence du futur): <img height="180" data-src="img/presence-futur.jpg"></img>

::
- Our data is the contemporary French novel
- We focus on popular subgenres like crime fiction and science fiction
- Here you see some book covers for crime fiction and science fiction


---
### What is distinctiveness?
* (Qualitative) concepts <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * aboutness
  * salience
  * discriminativity
  * etc.
* (Quantitative) measures <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * log-likelihood ratio
  * t-test
  * Burrows Zeta
  * etc. 

::
- (qualitative) concepts: 
- Aboutness: words that express the content of the subgenres
- Discriminativity: words that help distinguish between subgenres
- Salience: words that readers notice when reading novels from the subgenre
- (quantitative) measures
- log-likelihood (CL): compares frequencies across groups
- t-test (Statistics): compares frequency distibutions
- Zeta (CLS): compares the degree of dispersion of words


---
### Key issue: concepts vs. measures
* How do qualitative concepts and quantitative measures relate?
* What are the key statistical properties of the measures?
* Do different measures cover different aspects of distinctiveness?
* How do you evaluate measures for specific targets? 
  * discriminativity: classification task
  * salience: (comparison with reader survey)
  * aboutness: (proportion of content words)

::
- **Key issue**: 
- how do measures and concepts relate to each other?
- t-test has a bias for function words, and is related to distinctiveness
- Burrows Zeta has a bias for content words, and is related to aboutness
- How does this affect the results?
- These properties need to be established before using such measures.
- We do this through systematic evaluation with various techniques
- Note that no direct gold standard is available
- But also: how do we combine individual results, using different measures?


--
## Challenge 2:<br/><br/>Metadata

---
### Why is metadata crucial? 
* Small, well-understood corpora:<br/>metadata is easy to generate, less needed <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Large, unexplored corpora:<br/>metadata is crucial, hard to generate <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Why is it so crucial?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  * to know the population: sampling
  * to go beyond the known canon
  * for interpreting quantitative results

::
- First wave of CLS used relatively small corpora (dozens, sometimes a few hundred texts)
- Current wave of CLS is about ever larger text collections
- First thousands, now millions of books: HathiTrust: now 17 million volumes
- So metadata also helps us do analyses beyond the canon (see challenge #2: diversity)
- (a) Without a documentation of the statistical population, you can't create representative samples 
- (b) When you can't read the documents in your corpus, you need metadata to explain results


---
### Challenge of metadata
* CLS needs a complete record of literary production <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* CLS needs relevant, detailed, accurate metadata on texts <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * author: gender, related authors, etc. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * setting: space, time <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * content: themes, plot, protagonists <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  * type: subgenre <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  * properties: e.g. proportion of direct speech, <br/>narrative perspective <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

::
- First need: complete documentation of literary production (population)
- Second need: relevant, detailed, accurate metadata on individual texts
- But: Library catalogs usually don't have these
- So we need to generate metadata ourselves! (Agenda)

---
### Example: *Mining and Modeling Text*
<img height="450" data-src="img/mimotext-page.jpg"></img>
<br/>https://mimotext.uni-trier.de/aktuelles/english

---
### Generate metadata from various sources
<img height="500" data-src="img/mimotext-candide.jpg"></img>
<br/>Example: *Candide* by Voltaire

::
- from bibliographies and library catalogs
- from scholarly publications
- from primary texts


---
### Wikidata for Literary History
<img height="500" data-src="img/network-of-information_01-2021_v1.png"></img>
<br/>Example: Themes and setting of *Candide* by Voltaire

::
- Then, model it as an information network
- In the form of Linked Open Data
- Goal: Wikidata for Literary History



--
## Challenge 3:<br/><br/>Diversity

::
- The DH open up an opportunity for diversity
- We have the chance to base our research on more than just a few most famous works
- in CLS, this means we can better understand the dynamics of literary history
- And better understand the meaning of literature for people


---
### Distant Reading for European Literary History
<a href="img/map-of-action-members.html"><img height="450" data-src="img/map-of-action-members-logo.jpg"></img></a>
<br/>https://distant-reading.net

::
- I would  like to illustrate the challenges of this in CLS by speaking about a project called "Distant Reading for European Literary History"
- The key aim of this project is to create a multilingual corpus of novels
- 100 novels from as many different European languages as we can
- At the moment, we are working on 17 different languages


---
### Dimensions of diversity
* In corpus building and text analysis <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  * Literary production in multiple languages 
  * Highly-canonized and forgotten novels
  * Gender balance in authorship
  * Wide range of kinds of novels
* In the community we create <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  * Diversity of career stages
  * Gender balance
  * Researchers from less research-intensive countries

::
- Here we connect with work by Katherine Bode on corpus building
- In this project, there are several dimensions of diversity that are relevant
- regarding corpus building and text analysis (name them)
- regarding the community we create in the project (name them)
- Very important to me: diversity not for the people, but with the people! 
- In this sense, this is really a "grass-roots" project
- Digitization tends to be non-diverse (!): driven by canonicity, focused on few authors


---
### Key challenge: the "diversity paradox"
<a href="https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/"><img height="450" data-src="img/eltec.png"></img></a>
<br/>https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/


::
- Paradox: 
- We want to encourage a diversity of languages, including smaller literary traditions
- And we want to encourage a diverse corpus composition (women, non-canonized, early)
- But: for smaller languages, diverse composition is hard!
- So: by pushing on one side, we lose on the other side
- We need to balance both



--
## Challenge 4:<br/><br/>Reproducibility


---
### The reproducibility crisis
<img height="450" data-src="img/replication_scientific-american.png"></img>
<br/>[Roni Jackson, "Massive International Project...", 2015](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-international-project-raises-questions-about-the-validity-of-psychology-research/)

::
- For years, there has been discussion of a reproducibility crisis in psychology or biomedicine
- now, it is also relevant in computational linguistics and computer science 
- For example, the NeurIPS conference now has a "reproducibility chair"
- This is also becoming highly relevant to DH and CLS
- Evidence of this is the Paper by Nan Z. Da, "The Computational Case agains CLS" (2019)


---
### A typology of reproducing research
<img height="450" data-src="img/replication-typology.png"></img>
<br/>(Schöch 2020)

:: 
- But what does reproducible research even mean? 
- In CLS, there are lots of possible relations between previous and current researrch
- One way to get a better grip of this issue is through a typology
- We just focus on the left part (same research question)
- But the data can be similar or different; the method can be similar or diffferent
- In each configuration, there are different requirements
- But essentiallly, making data and code freely available to others is crucial


---
### Consequences for CLS
* Structurally encourage and facilitate sharing of corpora and code <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Recognize corpus design and code maintenance as scholarly work <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Develop solutions for sharing of in-copyright materials:<br/> "derived features/formats" (e.g. Hathi Trust Extracted Feature Dataset) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Develop reporting standards for research <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* But also: recognize the value of reproducing research (small steps!) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

::
- Would love to hear from you

## Conclusion

---
### Four Challenges of CLS
1. Operationalization: "deconstruction" and reconstruction of concepts and measures <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
1. Metadata: methods, and partnerships with libraries, to generate metadata for very large corpora <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
1. Diversity: increase diversity in research objects and the research community; find ways out of the diversity paradox <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
1. Reproducibility: enable and encourage sharing of data, code, methods <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
